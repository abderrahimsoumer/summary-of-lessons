# Cloud Jobs

## What is Cloud Computing?
Today, all companies are adopting cloud computing to enable their digital transformation. **The cloud tech services market is projected to grow 17.3% ($206 billion) in 2019.**

Cloud services such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud appeal to many organizations because of features such as **pay-per-use, ability to scale up or down based on usage, self-service**, and more.

All these benefits lead to much lower costs, faster time-to-market and better service quality compared with traditional methods.

The growth of this technology has created incredible demand for Cloud computing jobs, from Cloud developers and Cloud DevOps roles to more specialized roles such as solutions architects and Cloud security engineers. Regardless of the role, Cloud computing skills are in **high demand** and have the potential to **impact almost every industry**.
