## Measures of Spread
**Measures of Spread** are used to provide us an idea of how spread out our data are from one another. Common measures of spread include:

1. Range
2. Interquartile Range (IQR)
3. Standard Deviation
4. Variance

Throughout this lesson you will learn how to calculate these, as well as why we would use one measure of spread over another.

## Histograms

Histograms are super useful to understanding the different aspects of quantitative data. In the upcoming concepts, you will see histograms used all the time to help you understand the four aspects we outlined earlier regarding a quantitative variable:

- center
- spread
- shape
- outliers

## Calculating the 5 Number Summary

The five number summary consist of 5 values:

1. **Minimum** : The smallest number in the dataset.
2. **Q1**	: The value such that 25% of the data fall below.
3. **Q2** : The value such that 50% of the data fall below.
4. **Q4** : The value such that 75% of the data fall below.
5. **Maximum** : The largest value in the dataset.

In the above video we saw that calculating each of these values was essentially just finding the median of a bunch of different dataset. Because we are essentially calculating a bunch of medians, the calculation depends on whether we have an odd or even number of values.

### Range

The **range** is then calculated as the difference between the **maximum** and the **minimum.**

### IQR

The **interquartile range** is calculated as the difference between **Q3** and **Q1**.

In the upcoming sections, you will practice this with Katie and on your own.
