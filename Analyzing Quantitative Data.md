## Analyzing Quantitative Data

### Four Aspects for Quantitative Data
There are four main aspects to analyzing **Quantitative** data.

- Measures of `Center`
- Measures of `Spread`
- The `Shape` of the data.
- `Outliers`

### Analyzing Categorical Data

Though not discussed in the video, analyzing categorical data has fewer parts to consider. **Categorical** data is analyzed usually be looking at the counts or proportion of individuals that fall into each group. For example if we were looking at the breeds of the dogs, we would care about how many dogs are of each breed, or what proportion of dogs are of each breed type.

## Measures of Center

There are three measures of center:

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

## The Mean

In this video, we focused on the calculation of the mean. The mean is often called the average or the **expected value** in mathematics. We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together, and dividing by the number of values in our dataset.

The remaining measures of the median and mode will be discussed in detail in the upcoming quizzes and videos.
