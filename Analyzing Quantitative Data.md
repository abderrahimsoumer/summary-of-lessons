## Analyzing Quantitative Data

### Four Aspects for Quantitative Data
There are four main aspects to analyzing **Quantitative** data.

- Measures of `Center`
- Measures of `Spread`
- The `Shape` of the data.
- `Outliers`

### Analyzing Categorical Data

Though not discussed in the video, analyzing categorical data has fewer parts to consider. **Categorical** data is analyzed usually be looking at the counts or proportion of individuals that fall into each group. For example if we were looking at the breeds of the dogs, we would care about how many dogs are of each breed, or what proportion of dogs are of each breed type.

## Measures of Center

There are three measures of center:

- Mean
- Median
- Mode

## The Mean

In this video, we focused on the calculation of the mean. The mean is often called the average or the **expected value** in mathematics. We calculate the mean by adding all of our values together, and dividing by the number of values in our dataset.

The remaining measures of the median and mode will be discussed in detail in the upcoming quizzes and videos.

## The Median
The **median** splits our data so that 50% of our values are lower and 50% are higher. We found in this video that how we calculate the median depends on if we have an even number of observations or an odd number of observations.

### Median for Odd Values

If we have an **odd** number of observations, the **median** is simply the number in the **direct middle**. For example, if we have 7 observations, the median is the fourth value when our numbers are ordered from smallest to largest. If we have 9 observations, the median is the fifth value.

### Median for Even Values

If we have an **even** number of observations, the **median** is the **average of the two values in the middle**. For example, if we have 8 observations, we average the fourth and fifth values together when our numbers are ordered from smallest to largest.

In order to compute the median we MUST sort our values first.

Whether we use the mean or median to describe a dataset is largely dependent on the **shape** of our dataset and if there are any **outliers**. We will talk about this in just a bit!
