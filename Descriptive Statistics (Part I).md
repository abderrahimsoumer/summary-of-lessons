# Descriptive Statistics (Part I)

## Data Types
In this video, two data types are introduced: Quantitative and Categorical.

**Quantitative** data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).

**Categorical** are used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds - Collies, Labs, Poodles, etc.).

### Categorical Ordinal vs. Categorical Nominal

We can divide categorical data further into two types: **Ordinal** and **Nominal.**

**Categorical Ordinal** data take on a ranked ordering (like a ranked interaction on a scale from Very Poor to Very Good with the dogs).

**Categorical Nominal** data do not have an order or ranking (like the breeds of the dog).

## Continuous vs. Discrete

We can think of quantitative data as being either **continuous** or **discrete**.

**Continuous** data can be split into smaller and smaller units, and still a smaller unit exists. An example of this is the age of the dog - we can measure the units of the age in years, months, days, hours, seconds, but there are still smaller units that could be associated with the age.

**Discrete** data only takes on countable values. The number of dogs we interact with is an example of a discrete data type.
