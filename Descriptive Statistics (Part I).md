# Descriptive Statistics (Part I)

## Data Types
In this video, two data types are introduced: Quantitative and Categorical.

**Quantitative** data takes on numeric values that allow us to perform mathematical operations (like the number of dogs).

**Categorical** are used to label a group or set of items (like dog breeds - Collies, Labs, Poodles, etc.).
